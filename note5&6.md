## 第5&amp;6讲笔记

** 三．“废话”的定位 **
“废话”分为定语和状语

**英文逻辑基本表达式：(状1) 主 (定1) 谓 (状2) [宾] (定2/状1)**    

Remark:1）其中可以用“，；——”等符号引入插入语，即状2，例如in my opinion   2）状2可以理解为小状语  

**例句**：(状1)[Although not so world widely accepted,] 主[people] (定1)[1) who are emotionally weak 2) in daily business] 谓[are] (状2)[often] [宾][losers] (定2)[1) who are not able to fulfill any fruitful achievements 2) in their lifetime 3) that they endure.]

英文状语 1. 句首尾 2. 谓语后(小状语)
中文状语 1. 句首尾 2. 谓语前(小状语)
**Rule two**: **基本算法:倒序**
    设: 1,2,3

   **例句**： 1)Under a system 2)deployed 3)on the white house website 4)for the first time 5)at last time, those who want to send a message to President Bush must now navigate as many as
